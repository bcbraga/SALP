## Repository Update and Academic Reference

This repository consolidates and updates the original implementation of the **Student Allocation Layout Problem (SALP)**, initially developed as part of the doctoral thesis:

> Charytitsch, Bruna Cristina Braga. *Layered Graph Problems: New Perspectives and Applications*. SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos, 2024. 169 f.  
> Doctoral thesis in Operations Research â€“ Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de AeronÃ¡utica and Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo.  
> Advisor: Prof. Dr. MarÃ­a Cristina Vasconcelos Nascimento.

The original work has been refined and expanded, resulting in the **Student Seat Allocation Problem (SSAP)** and the associated research paper currently available in this repository.

ðŸ”— **This is the official and actively maintained implementation:**
